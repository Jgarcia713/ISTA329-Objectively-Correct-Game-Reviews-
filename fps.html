        <h3><b>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</b></h3>
        <h4>Review</h4>
        <p>The Call of Duty formula returns, this time shinier than ever. Modern Warfare II delivers smooth gunplay and Hollywood action sequences, but let’s be honest — it's a glorified rehash. Multiplayer? Addictive. Campaign? Flashy but forgettable. If you’ve played one, you’ve played them all... but you’ll still sink 50 hours in and love every killstreak.</p>
        <p>Under the hood, it's a premium gunplay simulator with corporate skin. The weapon animations and feel are top-tier, but convoluted unlock systems and the monetization model steal the soul from what could have been a classic. You pay $70 and still feel like a visitor in a free-to-play economy. It’s a feast for the senses, but a fast-food meal at heart.</p>

        <h3><b>Overwatch 2</b></h3>
        <h4>Review</h4>
        <p>It’s like Overwatch 1, but with a shiny coat of paint, fewer players, and more corporate baggage. Don’t get us wrong — it still has amazing hero design and satisfying team fights. But don’t call it a sequel. It’s Overwatch 1.5 with a battle pass. Fun? Yes. Revolutionary? Not even close.</p>
        <p>Behind the polished visuals and tight mechanics lies a game trying to sell you nostalgia with a subscription model. Heroes are creative, maps are solid, but Blizzard’s decision to axe PvE and lean into battle passes left a bitter taste. A decent shooter trapped in a monetization strategy.</p>
