		<h3> <b>Red Dead Redemption Two</b> </h3>
			<h4>Review</h4>
				<p>Red Dead Redemption Two is from Rockstar Games and follows Arthur Morgan in the Van Der Linde Gang. The
				vast open world is beautifully done and truly immerses you in the gameplay. Taking inspiration from late 19th century America,
				the world spans multiple counties. Each of these regions includes towns and settlements that are integral to the storyline
				and allow you to live as a cowboy in the Wild West.</p>

				<p> There is also an online version of the game, <i>Red Dead Online</i>, which allows you to create a character and take on roles to make your living.
				But beware! There are numerous hackers and modders who may kill your horse or hogtie you. Online is wonderful for when you want to play with
				your friends and explore the world together.<p>

				<p>This is my favorite game, and I have spent hundreds of hours exploring the world of Red Dead. In both RDO and RDR2 there are countless things to do and ways to play the game!</p>
				
				<h4>Here are some tips and tricks for online!</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Posse up! Join your friends to help complete missions and make money.</li>
					<li>Take advantage of the monthly rewards! This will maximize your profit and allow you to buy that nice horse :)</li>
					<li>Spend time exploring the map and becoming familiar with the towns and regions!</li>
				</ul>

		<h3><b>Ghost of Tsushima</b></h3>
			<h4>Review</h4>
				<p>In Ghost of Tsushima, you play as Jin Sakai, a samurai warrior who is faced with fighting against the Mongols invading the island
				 of Tsushima. The visuals are gorgeous and truly immerse you in the landscape and world of 13th century Japan. There is a captivating story that introduces you to new 
				people and places, and follows a tale of revenge and honor.</p>
				<p>I particularly enjoy this game for its location on Tsushima Island and how it is loosely based on Japanese history. The fighting style and stealth aspects are fun
				and unique, which makes the game stand out. You can easily spend hours exploring and completing quests! </p>

				<h4>Here are some tips and tricks for online!</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Spend time on the side missions! They will reward you with good items and tell the stories of other people on the island.</li>
					<li>Collect everything! Collecting everything you can will ensure you have the necessary resources for upgrades and items.</li>
					<li>Try different play styles and armor sets! Switching your play style or armor may give you benefits that help you finish challenging missions.</li>
				</ul>
